
ExpressJS Task
Welcome to the ExpressJS Task repository! This repository contains the solution for a simple RESTful API built using the Express.js framework. This README provides an overview of the task, instructions for setting up the project, and details on how to use the API.

Task Overview
The ExpressJS Task is a basic implementation of a RESTful API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of items. The API is built using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expressjs.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd expressjs-task
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and define the following environment variables:

plaintext
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/expressjs_db
Adjust the values as needed, especially the PORT and MONGODB_URI.

Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server should now be running on the specified port (default is 3000).

API Endpoints
The following endpoints are available in the API:

GET /items: Retrieve all items.
GET /items/:id: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
POST /items: Create a new item.
PUT /items/:id: Update an existing item.
DELETE /items/:id: Delete an item.
Usage
You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints. Here are some example requests:

Retrieve all items:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/items
Retrieve a specific item by ID:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/items/1
Create a new item:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"New Item"}' http://localhost:3000/items
Update an existing item:

bash
Copy code
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Updated Item"}' http://localhost:3000/items/1
Delete an item:

bash
Copy code
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/items/1
